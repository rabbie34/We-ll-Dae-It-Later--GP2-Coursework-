NOTE BEFORE PLAYING!

May need to copy over files in order for the GUI to work properly.
Go into the coursework folder>GP2>Lib and copy the 3 files from there into the libRocket>Lib folder on your PC.

Best to run the game without debugging for smoother gameplay. On visual studio, go to the debug drop down menu
and click start without debugging.

Gameplay controls are displayed in the menu. Can be done with mouse/keyboard or xbox controller.
Ability to shoot wasn't fully implemented therefore wont work properly. Only plays the sound.
