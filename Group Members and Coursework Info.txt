Gameplay controls are displayed in the menu. Can be done with mouse/keyboard or xbox controller.
Ability to shoot wasn't fully implemented therefore wont work properly. Only plays the sound.

May need to copy over files in order for the GUI to work properly.

Go into the coursework foler>GP2>Lib and copy/replace the 3 files into the libRocket>Lib folder on your PC.
